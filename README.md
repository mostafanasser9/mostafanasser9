# Hi there, I'm Mostafa Nasser! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, focused on full-stack web development. I have experience with core technologies like Java and JavaScript, and I build projects using frameworks such as React.js and Material UI. Iâ€™m also skilled in UI/UX design using Figma to create clean, user-friendly interfaces.

Currently, I'm expanding my backend skills by learning the .NET ecosystemâ€”including C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC & Web API), and SQL Server. I am passionate about building scalable, user-friendly applications and always eager to explore new tools and technologies.

I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and deepen my full-stack development experience.
