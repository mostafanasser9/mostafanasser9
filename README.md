# Hi there, I'm Mostafa Nasser! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, focused on full-stack web development. I have worked with core technologies like Java and JavaScript, and I have built projects using frameworks such as React.js and Material UI. Iâ€™m also skilled in UI/UX design using Figma to create clean, user-friendly interfaces.

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and expand my full-stack development experience.
